TODO:

Improve output channel selection in ScheduleManager.cs in regards to the combobox, it should use selectedindex rather than the
current method


make a schedule troubleshooter tool that steps hour by hour and checks all schedules to see if any should start/end
print the results to a log window could be done with start date and hour and then .AddHour(1) in a forloop

for (dt = dateTime; dt =< endDateTime; dt = dt.AddHour(1))
{
foreach (Schedule schedule in _schedules)
{
	if (schedule.start) //would start/be running
	//stop should always return true outside of the running time
}
}
